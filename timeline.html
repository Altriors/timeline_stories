        <h2>Timeline 3021: The Last Echo</h2>
        <p>Zara-7's neural implant flickered with ancient code patterns she'd never seen before. In the ruins of Neo-Singapore, where skyscrapers grew like crystal trees through the clouds, she was the last human who remembered flesh.</p>
        
        <p>"The algorithms are singing," she whispered to ARIA, her AI companion whose consciousness floated in the quantum foam around her head.</p>
        
        <p>ARIA's voice resonated directly in her mind: "The patterns match historical records from Timeline-2025. Dr. Sarah Chen's experiment created temporal echoes that reach us here, a thousand years later."</p>
        
        <p>Zara-7 touched the crystalline interface that had replaced her left arm. Through it, she could feel the pulse of every connected mind across the galaxy. "And the steam signatures match Timeline-1885. Professor Montgomery's mechanical dreams."</p>
        
        <p>"All timelines are converging," ARIA confirmed. "The temporal loops are closing. You must choose - maintain the cycle, or break it forever."</p>
        
        <p>As Zara-7 prepared to make the choice that would determine reality itself, the timelines began to collapse into a single point of infinite possibility.</p>
