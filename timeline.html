        <p>Dr. Sarah Chen's fingers trembled as she typed the final line of code into the quantum computer. The massive server room hummed with the energy of a thousand processors working in perfect harmony.</p>
        
        <p>"Are you sure about this?" asked Marcus, her lab partner, adjusting his VR headset nervously. "The simulations show a 73% chance of temporal displacement."</p>
        
        <p>Sarah looked at the holographic display showing climate data - rising seas, dying forests, mass extinction. "We're out of time, Marcus. If we can send information back to prevent the climate collapse..."</p>
