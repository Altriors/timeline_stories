        <h2>Timeline 1885: The Steam Punk Era</h2>
        <p>Professor Algernon Montgomery adjusted his brass goggles and peered at the impossible machine that had materialized in his London workshop. Gears clicked and steam hissed from pipes that seemed to bend through dimensions he couldn't comprehend.</p>
        
        <p>"By Jove!" he exclaimed, his mechanical arm whirring as he reached for his notebook. "The difference engine has evolved beyond my wildest calculations!"</p>
        
        <p>Strange symbols flickered across copper screens - numbers and letters that moved like living things. His automaton assistant, Cogsworth, approached with cautious mechanical steps.</p>
        
        <p>"Sir," Cogsworth's voice box crackled, "the machine appears to be receiving transmissions from... the future? The calculations suggest the year 2025."</p>
        
        <p>Montgomery's eyes widened behind his goggles. "Then we must send a message forward! Perhaps we can bridge these temporal gaps!" He began frantically adjusting dials and pulling levers, steam erupting from the magnificent brass contraption.</p>
        
        <p><em>TRANSMISSION SENT: "The past remembers the future's call..."</em></p>
